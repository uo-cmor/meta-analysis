## Systematic reviews and meta-analyses

<br>

***From Cochrane:***

* A systematic review is a study that\
*"attempts to identify, appraise, and synthesize all the empirical evidence that meets pre-specified eligibility criteria to answer a specific research question"*

* Meta-analysis is the statistical combination of results from two or more separate studies

  * Meta-analysis is often one part of a systematic review

## (Potential) advantages of meta-analyses

<br>

::: {}
* Improved precision
:::
::: {}
* Evidence on generalisability
:::
::: {}
* Resolve conflicting results from previous studies
:::

## Before doing a meta-analysis

<br>

* Do your systematic review well:

  * Define the review aims & scope (PICO)
  
  * Ensure your search strategy, screening, etc. is effective
  
  * Identify & summarise study characteristics
  
  * Decide whether studies are 'similar enough' to be grouped & synthesized

## Types of meta-analysis

<br>

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
* Pairwise comparisons (i.e., intervention vs. comparator; 'standard' meta-analysis)
:::
::: {}
* Network meta-analysis (comparing more than two interventions in a single model)
:::
::: {}
* Individual participant data meta-analysis
:::

## General approach to meta-analysis

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out fragment-index=1}
1. Extract (or calculate) a summary statistic for each study

2. Calculate (weighted) average effect across all studies

3. Calculate the standard error of the summary effect (to derive confidence intervals and/or p-values)

4. Estimate heterogeneity between studies

5. Summarise findings graphically (usually with a **forest plot**)

## 1. Extract/calculate statistics for each study

* For dichotomous outcomes:
  * Odds ratio
  * Risk ratio
  * Risk difference

* For continuous outcomes:
  * Mean difference
    * (post-intervention, change from baseline, adjusted post-intervention)
  * Standardised mean difference

## 1. Extract/calculate statistics for each study

*  For ordinal outcomes:
  * Usually either treated as dichotomous or continuous
  * Also possible to estimate a proportional odds ratio
  
* For count outcomes:
  * Again, usually treated as dichotomous or continuous
  * Rate ratio or rate difference

* For time-to-event outcomes:
  * Hazard ratio

## 2. Calculate weighted effect

* Generally, meta-analyses use an **inverse-variance weighted method**

$$\text{Weighted average} = \frac{\sum{Y_i W_i}}{\sum{W_i}}$$

\ \ \ where $W_i = (1 / SE_i)^2$

* For ratio measures, both the effects and standard errors are on the log scale
  * These can be transformed back to the original scale for reporting

* There are slight variants to this general approach for some methods (particularly for dichotomous outcomes)

## 3. Calculate standard errors

* In the general inverse-variance method, the standard error of the weighted summary statistic is

$$\text{Standard error} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum{W_i}}}$$

* Again, different formulae for some specific methods

## 4. Estimate heterogeneity

* Heterogeneity is measured by\
\
$Q = \sum{W_i (Y_i - \overline{Y})^2}$\
\
and\
\
$I^2 = \text{max}\left\{\frac{Q - (k - 1)}{Q}, 0\right\}$\

* Q is a test statistic following a chi-squared distribution, and I^2^ is interpreted as the proportion of total variance in study estimates due to heterogeneity rather than sampling error
  * ***NOTE:*** I^2^ can be very uncertain (imprecise) when the number of studies is small

## 5. Summarise findings graphically

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out fragment-index=1}
* Meta-analyses are usually illustrated using a forest plot

* A forest plot displays effect estimates for both individual studies and the overall meta-analysis result

* Each study is represented by a square (usually) at the point estimate, and horizontal lines extending to bounds of the confidence interval

  * The size of the block indicates the weight assigned to that study in the meta-analysis (roughly proportional to sample size)

* The summary result is presented as a diamond at the bottom, centred on the meta-analysis point estimate and with width showing the confidence interval

## Assessing small-study bias and publication bias

To be added

## Software

* Cochrane RevMan
  * Manages all stages of the systematic review process, from design to data extraction, analysis, and visualiation
  * Free for those doing Cochrane reviews, subscription for everyone else

* R: there are several packages for meta-analysis
  * See the Meta-Analysis Task View:\
  <https://cran.r-project.org/view=MetaAnalysis>
  * [`metafor`](https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/) is a comprehensive package with functions for converting published results to common summary statistics, fitting inverse-variance weighted and related models, forest and funnel plots, heterogeneity measures, and diagnostic statistics (among others)
